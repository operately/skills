## Verify CLI Is Installed

Before any CLI operation, confirm the CLI is available:

```bash
 operately --version
```

If this does not print the version number, the CLI is **not installed**. Stop and tell the user:

> The Operately CLI is not installed. Install it with `npm install -g @operately/operately-cli` and then re-run this task.

Do **not** attempt to install the CLI on behalf of the user. Do **not** continue without a working CLI.

Only after confirming the binary exists should you verify the session:

```bash
operately auth whoami
```

Interpret failures carefully:
- `command not found` from `whoami` still means the CLI is missing.
- Authentication or connection errors mean the CLI exists but the current session cannot reach Operately yet. Tell the user the CLI is installed but the session/auth is not working, and ask them to login.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Authenticate

Prefer direct token login for automation, CI, or any non-interactive task. Generate an API token in the Operately UI at **Profile → API Tokens**, then:

```bash
operately auth login --token <your-token>
operately auth whoami
```

**Important:** If you don't specify `--base-url` when logging in, the CLI defaults to `https://app.operately.com`. For self-hosted or staging environments, always provide the `--base-url` flag:

```bash
# Self-hosted instance
operately auth login --token <token> --base-url https://operately.yourcompany.com

# Check current base URL
operately auth whoami
```

### Auth Flow Rules For Agents

- `operately auth login --token <token>` is the safest path for automation and headless work. It validates the token and saves a profile without using the interactive bootstrap flow.
- If an agent must use `operately auth login` without an existing token, prefer passing all known login data as flags so the CLI only asks for the unavoidable manual steps.
- The two unavoidable manual login steps are: Google login browser confirmation, and email-code login verification-code entry from the user's email.
- If an agent must use `operately auth signup`, prefer passing all known signup data as flags so the CLI only asks for the unavoidable manual steps.
- The two unavoidable manual signup steps are: Google signup browser confirmation, and email/password signup verification-code entry from the user's email.
- All `operately auth ...` commands are handcrafted in `cli/src/auth/`, with the per-flow modules under `cli/src/auth/flows/`. They are not generated from backend `external_endpoints`, even though the rest of the CLI command surface is generated.
- Use interactive auth commands only when a human can answer prompts. For Google flows, also assume a browser is required.
- `operately auth profiles` and `operately auth status` only report local CLI config state. They do not prove the saved token is valid. Use `operately auth whoami` when you need remote verification.
- If the task involves choosing between login, signup, join, invite handling, or understanding which backend/internal endpoints the CLI will hit, read `references/auth-flows.md` before acting.

### Agent-Friendly Login Examples

Prefer these over the fully interactive bootstrap flow when the necessary details are already known:

```bash
# Password login: fully flag-driven when company and access mode are known
operately auth login \
  --method email-password \
  --email user@example.com \
  --password secret123456 \
  --company-id <company-id> \
  --access-mode full-access \
  --profile work

# Email-code login: only the emailed verification code remains manual
operately auth login \
  --method email-code \
  --email user@example.com \
  --company-name "Acme Corp" \
  --access-mode read-only

# Google login: browser confirmation remains manual
operately auth login \
  --method google \
  --company-name "Acme Corp" \
  --access-mode full-access
```

### Agent-Friendly Signup Examples

Prefer these over the fully interactive signup flow when the necessary details are already known:

```bash
# Email/password signup: only the emailed verification code remains manual
operately auth signup \
  --method email-password \
  --full-name "New User" \
  --email newuser@example.com \
  --password secret123456 \
  --next-step later

# Google signup: browser confirmation remains manual
operately auth signup \
  --method google \
  --next-step later
```

### Authentication Options

Three ways to provide authentication:

1. **Saved profile** (recommended for local use):
   ```bash
   operately auth login --token <token>
   ```

2. **Environment variables** (best for CI/scripts):
   ```bash
   export OPERATELY_API_TOKEN=op_live_xxx
   export OPERATELY_BASE_URL=https://app.operately.com
   export OPERATELY_PROFILE=default
   ```

3. **Per-command flags** (temporary overrides):
   ```bash
   operately people get_me --token <token> --base-url <url>
   ```

Priority: command flags > environment variables > saved profile.

### Multiple Environments

Use profiles for different environments:

```bash
# Production (default)
operately auth login --token op_live_xxx

# Staging
operately auth login --token op_staging_xxx --profile staging --base-url https://staging.operately.com

# Local development
operately auth login --token op_local_xxx --profile local --base-url http://localhost:4000
```

Switch profiles:
```bash
operately people get_me --profile staging
operately auth profiles
```

### Interactive Auth Flow Summary

- `operately auth login` is hybrid for password, email-code, and Google login: with no flags it is fully interactive, but any provided login flags suppress the matching prompts. Google login still requires browser confirmation, and email-code login still requires the emailed verification code. If no `--method` flag is provided, the interactive menu still includes prompted token entry as an option.
- `operately auth signup` is hybrid: with no flags it is fully interactive, but any provided signup flags suppress the matching prompts. Google signup still requires browser confirmation, and email/password signup still requires the emailed verification code.
- `operately auth create-company` is hybrid: with no flags it is fully interactive, but any provided flags suppress the matching prompts. It authenticates with email/password, email code, or Google OAuth, then creates a company and saves a full-access profile.
- `operately auth join` is hybrid: with no flags it is fully interactive, but any provided flags suppress the matching prompts. It starts from an invite token and routes differently for personal invites vs company-wide invites.
- When an interactive flow needs a profile name and `--profile` is not provided, the CLI prompts with the current active profile as the default; blank input accepts that default.
- In bootstrap login flows, the CLI usually exchanges a short-lived bootstrap token for a company-scoped API token and then saves the resulting profile.
- The detailed decision tree, prompt behavior, and endpoint mapping live in `references/auth-flows.md`.

**Method prerequisites — confirm access BEFORE choosing a method:**

| Method | Required access |
|---|---|
| `--token` | The API token itself |
| `email-password` (login) | Email address AND password |
| `email-password` (signup) | Email address AND inbox access (a code is sent during signup) |
| `email-code` | Email address AND inbox access (a code is sent and must be read) |
| `google` | Browser access for the OAuth confirmation step |

- **Never choose Google OAuth** in headless, CI, or automated contexts — it always requires a human to confirm in the browser.
- **Never choose email-code** without confirmed inbox access — a code is always sent and must be entered.
- **Always pass known values as flags** (`--method`, `--email`, `--password`, `--company-name`, etc.) to suppress every prompt that can be suppressed. Only leave a step interactive when it is truly unavoidable (browser confirmation or entering an emailed code).

### 2. Command Structure

Commands follow the API endpoint naming:

```bash
operately <namespace> <endpoint_name> [flags]
```

Examples:
```bash
operately people get_me
operately people update_picture --avatar-file path-to-avatar-file
operately projects list
operately goals create --name "Q2 Revenue Goal" --space-id s1
operately tasks update_status --task-id t1 --type project --status.id done --status.label "Done" --status.color green --status.index 2 --status.value done --status.closed true
operately files create --resource-hub-id r1 --file path-to-file
```

### 3. Input Flags

Flags map to API fields using kebab-case:

**Simple values:**
```bash
operately projects update_name --project-id p1 --name "New Name"
```

**Booleans:**
```bash
operately projects get --id p1 --include-space
operately projects get --id p1 --include-space=true
```

**Include flags (`--include-*`)**

Include flags request extra related data or expanded result sets in the response. If an include flag is omitted, that data is **not returned**, but that does **not** mean the underlying resource does not have it. It means the CLI/API did not preload it.
If the matching include flag was requested and the field is still missing, then treat that as the resource/data not existing for that object.

Examples:
- `operately projects get --id p1` will return the base project without `space`, `milestones`, or `contributors`.
- `operately projects get --id p1 --include-space --include-milestones` requests those fields explicitly.
- `operately projects get --id p1 --include-subscription-list` is required before using notification subscription commands that need the `subscription_list`.

When reading CLI help:
- Keep the flat `Input flags:` list in mind.
- If help ends with `Include flag behavior:`, treat the listed resources as opt-in fields.
- Do not infer “no milestones”, “no contributors”, or similar conclusions just because the field is missing from a response unless the matching include flag was requested.

**Nulls:**
```bash
operately goals update_due_date --goal-id g1 --due-date null
```

**Arrays** (repeat the flag):
```bash
operately notifications mark_many_as_read --ids n1 --ids n2
```

**Nested objects** (dot-index notation):
```bash
operately projects update_task_statuses \
  --task-statuses.0.id ts1 \
  --task-statuses.0.label "To Do" \
  --task-statuses.1.id ts2 \
  --task-statuses.1.label "Done"
```

**Markdown content:**

Many commands accept markdown content (documents, descriptions, check-ins). Use `\n` for line breaks and escape special characters, or use `--<field>-file <path>` to load the same content from a markdown file:

```bash
# Simple markdown
operately documents create \
  --resource-hub-id rh1 \
  --name "Team Guide" \
  --content "# Getting Started\n\nWelcome to the team."

# Rich markdown with multiple elements
operately documents create \
  --resource-hub-id rh1 \
  --name "API Documentation" \
  --content "# API Guide\n\n## Authentication\n\nUse Bearer tokens:\n\n\`\`\`bash\ncurl -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' https://api.example.com\n\`\`\`\n\n## Endpoints\n\n- **GET /users** - List users\n- **POST /users** - Create user\n\n### Response Format\n\n\`\`\`\n{\n  \"users\": [...]\n}\n\`\`\`"

# Project description with formatting
operately projects update_description \
  --project-id p1 \
  --description "# Q2 Roadmap\n\n## Goals\n\n1. Launch new feature\n2. Improve performance\n\n## Timeline\n\n- **May:** Design phase\n- **June:** Development\n- **July:** Launch"

# Project description from a markdown file
operately projects update_description \
  --project-id p1 \
  --description-file ./roadmap.md
```

**Binary file uploads:**

Some commands accept a real local file path and upload the bytes, not just markdown content:

```bash
# Update your profile picture from a local image
operately people update_picture --avatar-file ./avatar.png

# Remove your profile picture
operately people update_picture --clear

# Upload one file into a resource hub
operately files create \
  --resource-hub-id rh1 \
  --file ./quarterly-report.pdf

# Upload one file into a folder
operately files create \
  --resource-hub-id rh1 \
  --folder-id f1 \
  --file ./quarterly-report.pdf \
  --name "Quarterly Report" \
  --description-file ./quarterly-report.md
```

Rules for file inputs:
- `people update_picture` accepts `--avatar-file <path>` to upload or `--clear` to remove the current picture.
- `files create` accepts exactly one `--file <path>` per command.
- `files create --name` overrides the base filename while preserving the source extension.
- `--description-file <path>` still means "load markdown from disk"; the uploaded binary stays on `--file <path>`.
- Do not try to create blobs manually first. These commands already handle blob creation, upload, preview generation, and finalization.

Supported markdown:
- Headings: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
- Bold: `**text**`, Italic: `*text*`
- Lists: `- item` or `1. item`
- Links: `[text](url)`
- Code: `` `inline` `` or `` ```block``` ``
- Line breaks: `\n`

**Access Levels:**

Many create commands require access level parameters to control who can view and interact with resources:

- `--anonymous-access-level` - Access for non-authenticated users (not supported yet, always use `0`)
- `--company-access-level` - Access for company members
- `--space-access-level` - Access for space members

**Access level values:**
- `0` - No access
- `10` - View only
- `40` - Comment
- `70` - Edit
- `100` - Full access

**Common pattern for team resources:**
```bash
--anonymous-access-level 0 \
--company-access-level 10 \
--space-access-level 70
```

**Note:** Get commands use generic `--id` parameter, while create/update commands use entity-specific IDs like `--project-id`, `--goal-id`, etc.

### 4. Output Options

```bash
# Pretty JSON (default)
operately people get_me

# Compact JSON
operately people get_me --compact

# Save to file
operately projects get --id p1 --output ./project.json

# Verbose mode (shows request details)
operately people get_me --verbose
```

## Available Namespaces

The CLI provides access to the external API across these namespaces:

- **comments** - Comment management on resources
- **companies** - Company settings, members, permissions
- **documents** - Document creation and management in resource hubs
- **files** - File upload, retrieval, renaming, and deletion in resource hubs
- **goals** - Goal management, check-ins, targets
- **links** - Link management in resource hubs
- **notifications** - Notification preferences and subscriptions
- **people** - User and team member management, including profile picture updates
- **projects** - Project management, milestones, check-ins
- **reactions** - Emoji reactions to content
- **resource_hubs** - Resource hub and folder operations
- **spaces** - Space (team/department) management
- **tasks** - Task management across projects

## Assignments and Reviews

Get all items requiring your attention or review with a single command:

```bash
operately people list_assignments
```

This returns assignments categorized into three groups:

- **`due_soon`** - Items you own that are overdue, due today, or due soon
- **`needs_review`** - Items where you are the reviewer (check-ins, goal updates) awaiting acknowledgment
- **`upcoming`** - Items you own with future due dates

Each category contains groups of assignments organized by their origin (project, goal, or space). Assignments include:

- **Milestones** - Project milestones you own
- **Tasks** - Project and space tasks assigned to you
- **Projects** - Projects you own or are reviewing
- **Goals** - Goals you own or are reviewing
- **Check-ins** - Project and goal check-ins requiring your review

The response structure groups related items together and sorts by urgency, making it easy to prioritize your work. Items needing review show the author's name and what action is required.

**See:** `references/assignments-and-reviews.md` for detailed examples, filtering techniques, and integration workflows.

## Projects

### Create Project

```bash
operately projects create \
  --space-id s1 \
  --name "Q2 Product Roadmap" \
  --anonymous-access-level 0 \

  --space-access-level 70
```

### Get Project

```bash
operately projects get \
  --id p1 \
  --include-space \
  --include-milestones
```

If you omit `--include-space` or `--include-milestones`, those fields will be absent from the response even when the project has a space or milestones. Missing included data usually means “not preloaded,” not “does not exist.”

### Update Project

```bash
operately projects update_name --project-id p1 --name "Q2 Roadmap"
operately projects update_description --project-id p1 --description "# Overview\n\nQ2 goals..."
operately projects update_due_date --project-id p1 --due-date 2024-06-30
```

  --company-permissions 10 \
  --public-permissions 0
```

### Manage Members

```bash
# Add members
operately spaces add_members \
  --space-id s1 \
  --members.0.id u1 \
  --members.0.access-level 70 \
  --members.1.id u2 \
  --members.1.access-level 40

# List members
operately spaces list_members --space-id s1

# Remove member
operately spaces delete_member --space-id s1 --member-id u1

  --tools.tasks-enabled true \
  --tools.discussions-enabled true \
  --tools.resource-hub-enabled true
```

## Resource Hubs

See [Resource Hubs Reference](references/resource-hubs.md) for detailed workflows.

### Find Resource Hub ID

Every space already has a resource hub. To find the resource hub ID for a space:

```bash
operately spaces list_tools --space-id s1
```

Use the returned resource hub ID with `documents`, `files`, `links`, and `resource_hubs`.

operately resource_hubs create_folder \
  --resource-hub-id rh1 \
  --folder-id f1 \
  --name "Onboarding"

# Rename folder
operately resource_hubs rename_folder \
  --folder-id f1 \
  --new-name "Team Guides"

# Move folder
operately resource_hubs update_parent_folder \
  --resource-id f2 \

## Discussions

### Create Discussion

```bash
# Space discussion
operately spaces create_discussion \
  --space-id s1 \
  --title "Q2 Planning" \
  --body "# Q2 Planning\n\nLet's discuss priorities."

# Space discussion from a markdown file
operately spaces create_discussion \
  --space-id s1 \
  --title "Q2 Planning" \
  --body-file ./q2-planning.md

  --message "# Architecture\n\nProposed changes..."

# Goal discussion
operately goals create_discussion \
  --goal-id g1 \
  --title "Target Adjustment" \
  --message "Should we revise our targets?"
```

### List Discussions

```bash
operately spaces list_discussions --space-id s1
operately projects list_discussions --project-id p1
operately goals list_discussions --goal-id g1
```

## Comments

```bash
# Create comment
operately comments create \
  --entity-id e1 \
  --entity-type "project_check_in" \
  --content "Great progress!"

# List comments
operately comments list --entity-id e1 --entity-type "project_check_in"

# Update comment
operately comments update --comment-id c1 --parent-type project_check_in --content "Updated comment"

# Delete comment
operately comments delete --comment-id c1 --parent-type project_check_in
```

## Notifications

```bash
# List notifications
operately notifications list

# Get unread count
operately notifications get_unread_count

# Mark as read
operately notifications mark_as_read --id n1

# Mark many as read
operately notifications mark_many_as_read \
  --ids n1 \
  --ids n2

# Mark all as read
operately notifications mark_all_as_read

# Check subscription status (uses resource-id)
operately notifications is_subscribed \
  --resource-id r1 \
  --resource-type project

# Get subscription-list-id from the resource first
operately projects get \
  --id r1 \
  --include-subscription-list

# Subscribe to resource (uses subscription-list-id from above)
operately notifications subscribe \
  --subscription-list-id <subscription-list-id> \
  --type project

# Unsubscribe from subscription list (uses subscription-list-id)
operately notifications unsubscribe \
  --subscription-list-id <subscription-list-id>
```

If `subscription_list` is missing from the `projects get` response, do not assume the project lacks one. It means `--include-subscription-list` was omitted and the field was not preloaded.

## People

```bash
# Get current user
operately people get_me

# Get user by ID
operately people get --id u1

# List people
operately people list

# Search people
operately people search --query "john"

# Update profile
operately people update \
  --id u1 \
  --title "Senior Engineer" \
  --manager-id u2

# Set profile picture from a local image
operately people update_picture --avatar-file ./avatar.png

# Remove profile picture
operately people update_picture --clear
```

## Company

# Get company
operately companies get

# List companies
operately companies list

# Get work map
operately companies get_work_map

# Global search

# Create member
operately companies create_member \
  --full-name "John Doe" \
  --email "john@example.com" \
  --title "Engineer"
```

## Help System

The CLI provides built-in help at three levels:

**Namespace-level help** - List all commands in a namespace:
```bash
operately <namespace>
operately <namespace> --help
```

Examples:
```bash
operately projects
operately goals --help
```

Both forms display all available commands within that namespace.

**Command-level help** - Show command description and parameters:
```bash
operately <namespace> <command> --help
```

Examples:
```bash
operately projects create --help
operately goals update_target_value --help
```

This displays:
- Command description
- All required parameters (marked with `(required)`)
- All optional parameters
- Parameter types and formats

**Auth command help** - Show all flags, validation rules, and examples for any `auth` subcommand:
```bash
operately auth <command> --help
operately help auth <command>
```

Examples:
```bash
operately auth login --help
operately auth join --help
operately auth create-company --help
operately auth signup --help
```

This displays the full flag list, accepted method aliases, validation rules, and copy-paste examples for that specific auth command. **Always run this before executing an auth command when uncertain about available flags or their constraints.**

**Auth overview help** - List all auth subcommands:
```bash
operately auth
operately help auth
```

**General help:**
```bash
operately help
```

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Success
- `1` - Auth precondition not met (e.g., logout attempted when not logged in)
- `2` - CLI usage/validation error
- `3` - Missing authentication token/config
- `4` - API 4xx error (client error)
- `5` - API 5xx/network/fatal error (server error)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failures

Check authentication setup:
```bash
operately auth profiles
operately auth status
operately auth whoami
```

Interpret them differently:
- `operately auth profiles` lists saved local profiles, marks the active one, and shows saved metadata/base URLs.
- `operately auth status` checks whether the CLI has local profile/token config.
- `operately auth whoami` checks whether the current token actually works against the target Operately instance.

If token is invalid or expired, login again:
```bash
operately auth login --token <new-token>
```

### Command Not Found

Verify CLI is installed:
```bash
command -v operately
npm list -g @operately/operately-cli
```

Update to latest version:
```bash
npm update -g @operately/operately-cli
operately --version
```

### API Errors

Use verbose mode to see request details:
```bash
operately projects get --id p1 --verbose
```

Check the API response for specific error messages.

### Missing Required Fields

Use help to see required flags:
```bash
operately help projects create
```

Required fields are marked with `(required)` in the help output.
